Adrien is (remotely) presenting recent work on [`cvc.lean`] at Amazon Web Services üêô

The talk will be about 40 minutes and demo-heavy. We want to show [`cvc.lean`]'s API-s, as well as
the work we did on safety and ergonomics.

A heavily documented, text version of the presentation can be found in the [`2025_02_demo`
branch][demo branch] of the [`cvc.lean` repository][`cvc.lean`]:
