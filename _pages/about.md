Anzenlang (安全言語) is specialized in software safety through language safety: strong-typing,
formal verification, high language expressiveness... That's why we love [Lean 4][lean] and
[Rust][rust].

<br>

We mostly work with academics on language-related topics:

- DSL conception, compilation and verification, especially for (critical) embedded systems;

- theorem proving in Lean 4, for software safety and fundamental results;

- Lean 4, Rust, and formal verification training.
